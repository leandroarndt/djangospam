Django antispam module with an invisible fake comment/contact form,
cookie based middleware and Akismet verification.

Quick start
===========

These are the basic steps for using djangospam. You can get more info on
the cited modules and at :mod:`djangospam.settings`.

Fake form with cookie middleware
--------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.3.0

The cookie middleware uses cookies to identify known spam bots. Simple
crawlers usually don't accept cookies, but spam bots may accept, since
a website may require this to receive comments. In order to use the
cookie middleware, add :mod:`djangospam.cookie.middleware.SpamCookieMiddleware`
to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` at your settins file (usually `settings.py`).
In your template, insert **before** the true form::
    
    {% include 'djangospam/cookieform.html' %}

You must also add `(r"^somewhere/", include("djangospam.cookie.urls")`
to your url patterns (usually in your root urls.conf; `somewhere`
may be any path, except the one used for true posts).

Fake form without middleware
----------------------------

You may also use the fake form without the cookie middleware. This will
*not* block access from known spam bots. In order to do this,
include `djangospam` in your installed modules (at `settings.py`) and
insert the following code in your template, **before** the true form::

    {% include 'djangospam/form.html' %}

You may also define a `spam_uri` context variable with the
fake formulary destination URI. If no URI is defined, the form will be posted
at the same address of the page in which the form has been placed
(it will be used a
`<form method="post" action="">...</form>`
code). The destination address must accept POST requests and should not change
the database.

You may customize the fake formulary by copying it's template to
`template/djangospam` at your application's directory and editing it.

Cookie-based moderator
----------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.4.0

:mod:`djangospam.cookie.moderator` defines a cookie-based comment moderator
that should be attached to
your commented model. This moderator tests comment post requests for
the djangospam cookie and discards those which don't have it.
See :mod:`djangospam.cookie.middleware` for more info on the cookie system.
Code that uses this comment moderator **must** use that middleware.

Your models file should be like this::
    
    from djangospam.cookie import moderator as cookie
    
    class MyModel(...):
        ...
    
    try:
        cookie.register(MyModel)
    except cookie.AlreadyModerated:
        pass

Akismet
-------

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

:mod:`djangospam.akismet.moderator` defines an Akismet-based comment moderator.
Besides including `djangospam` in your installed modules (at `settings.py`),
you should insert the following code to your models file::
    
    from djangospam.akismet import moderator as akismet
    
    class MyModel(...):
        ...
    
    try:
        akismet.register(MyModel)
    except akismet.AlreadyModerated:
        pass

.. warning::
    Since version 0.4.0, the Akismet moderator has been turned a separate
    subpackage. Code using it must be rewritten as follows::
        
        from djangospam import akismet
        
    must be changed to::
        
        from djangospam.akismet import moderator as akismet
    
    Using from `djangospam import akismet` is now deprecated and won't be
    available from 1.0.0 on.
    
You also **must** define the variables below at `settings.py`:

AKISMET_BLOG
    Your home page URL, including http://
AKISMET_KEY
    Your application key at akismet.com
AKISMET_USERAGENT
    Your application name
AKISMET_USERAGENT_VERSION
    Your application version

Results
=======

The fake form alone is getting more than 99,9% (*circa* 1,399 out of 
1,400 spam comments) efficiency at
http://www.correioprogressista.com.br/, which used to have more than 200
spam comments each day. Even so, I recommend using Akismet or another
spam analysis tool.

On the first 14 hours of the cookie middleware at the same website,
it identified 244 spammers and blocked 68 requests from known spammers::
    
    $ grep -c "BLOCK RESPONSE" spam.log 
    244
    $ grep -c "SPAM REQUEST" spam.log 
    68
